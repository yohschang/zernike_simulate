    All displacements are listed relative to the chief ray at the reference wavelength
    for each field.

    The scale factor has been set such that one inch represents   0.06860 MM



    Spot diagrams are not allowed to overlap.  Points lying outside a
     0.21944 X  0.21944 MM rectangle centered at the chief ray are not plotted.
